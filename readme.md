# Uniform Graph Draw


This package implements random draw algorithm for networks. In particular it creates uniform samples of networks with a
given degree-sequence and partition constraints (fixed number of crossing edges/arrows between node-groups in partition).
The literature reefers to this set of constraint also as Partition Adjacency Matrix (PAM) restrictions. 

It is implemented according to the paper:

## Get it Running 

Install the package via pip:

- pip install ugd
 
then run
    
    #import modules
    import ugd
    import numpy
    
    # create adjacency matrix
    adj_m = numpy.zeros((4,4))
    adj_m[0,1] = 1
    adj_m[1,0] = 1
    adj_m[3,2] = 1
    adj_m[2,3] = 1
    
    # create dictionary of node attributes
    var_dict ={
        0: {'gender': 'm'},
        1: {'gender': 'm'},
        2: {'gender': 'f'},
        3: {'gender': 'f'},
    }
    
    # UNDIRECTED CASE, test whether there are abnormal many connection between groups:
    
    # test undirected: note there are 3 possible networks, and only one has no male, female edges
    out_dict = ugd.graph_hyp_test(adj_m=adj_m, var_dict = var_dict, test_variable= ('gender','m','f'),mixing_time=1000, anz_sim=100, show_polt=True)
    
    # DIRECTED CASE, test a utility funktion with the local optimal test:
    
    # testing whether there is taste for reciprocity:
    def edge_util_function(adj_m):
        # the utility is reciprocity -> i gets utility form an edge to j if j has an edge to i
        return numpy.transpose(adj_m)
    
    optimal_stat_for_reciprocity = ugd.make_lcl_mst_pwf_stat(adj_m, edge_util_function= edge_util_function)
    
    # there are 9 graphs, for 3 the reciprocity is high, for 6 low, due to symmetry the optimal stat only takes on 2 values
    out_dict = ugd.digraph_hyp_test(adj_m=adj_m, stat_f=optimal_stat_for_reciprocity , mixing_time=100, anz_sim=100, show_polt=False)
    
    print("is stat value of the original graph:")
    print(out_dict["info_dict"]["original_value"])
    print("the values of the simulated graphs:")
    print(out_dict["stat_list"])
    var_dict = var_dict, test_variable= ('gender','m','f'),mixing_time=1000, anz_sim=100, show_polt=True)

### Working with ugd

The easiest way to use ugd is by simply passing in the adjacency matrix and set show_plot=True. This runs the simulation
algorithm and plots a default statistic. 

The statistic can be customized. Firstly by entering a dictionary with node characteristics and testing for one characteristic.
Secondly by writing a custom test statistic and passing it into the function as 'stat_f'. How to write a "locally most powerful"
test statistic for a specific network formation game is derived in *Pelican, A. & Graham, B. S. (2019)*. The weights for the optimal
test statistic are not calculated by this package, it has to be done with other statistical packages and
feed in via 'stat_f' or directly applied to the list of graphs returned by the ugd package.

Node characteristic can be added as controls. The algorithm then generated uniformly graphs with also have the same number
of edges between the node-groups induced by the controls. Note that the algorithm is slower if many controls are added. 
Hard constraints (where there are no edges within, or across some the groups), such as the group constraint in a bipartite graph 
do not slow the algorithm.

The processing of the individual graphs can be easily customized by working directly with the simulated graphs.

An entry point of testing social and economic networks can be found here [https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00099](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00099.pdf).

## API

There are 3 functions provided.

1) graph_hyp_test
    - generating a sequence of uniform sampled *graphs* under the desired set of constrains.
2) digraph_hyp_test
    - generating a sequence of uniform sampled *digraphs* under the desired set of constrains.
3) make_lcl_mst_pwf_stat
    - making a locally optimal test statistic from the edge utility and the observed network.
      The locally optimal test statistic can then be used in digraph_hpy_test.

For the API the first two functions only differs in that the interpretation of the adjacency matrix is once 
as digraph representation and once as graph representation.

### Comment

The current implementation, includes only controlling of a fixed number of crossing edges/arrows between node-groups as 
constraints. More complex constraints can be implemented by writing a custom implementation of the *no_violation* function 
in *constraint_violation_check*. Note, that depending on the constraint the construction of the Schlaufen sequence should
not be stopped because a feasible one is found, but only due to the random stop. This in order to preserve correctness.
